# .htaccess
#
# This file is used by Apache web servers to configure server settings
# for the current directory and its subdirectories.
# Here, it's primarily used for URL rewriting to enable "pretty URLs"
# and direct all requests to the index.php front controller.

# Turn on the Rewrite Engine
RewriteEngine On

# Set the RewriteBase to the directory where your index.php is located.
# If your project is in the root of your web server, it might be /
# If it's in a subdirectory like example.com/your_project_name/public/, it would be /your_project_name/public/
# Adjust this based on your server setup.
RewriteBase /

# Rewrite all requests that are not for actual files or directories
# to index.php. This ensures that your Router class handles all URLs.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]

# QSA (Query String Append): Appends the query string from the original request to the rewritten URL.
# L (Last Rule): Stops processing further rewrite rules if this rule matches.

# Optional: Disable directory listing
Options -Indexes

# Optional: Set default charset (if not already set in php.ini or server config)
AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
